These POIs usually contain a group of places with similar locations, so the names should be more descriptive, must adding attributives to indicate that they are different places in the same area, such as \"\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\" is better than \"\u5317\u4eac\", \"\u676d\u5dde\u897f\u6e56\" is better than \"\u897f\u6e56\"; in addition, if you can determine that a location may appear in multiple areas, you can be more specific, such as \"\u676d\u5dde\u897f\u6e56\u7684\u82cf\u5824\u6625\u6653\" is better than \"\u82cf\u5824\u6625\u6653\". The tool will use these keywords to search for specific POIs and query their detailed data, such as latitude and longitude, location photos, etc. For example, [\"\u897f\u5b89\u949f\u697c\", \"\u897f\u5b89\u5927\u5510\u4e0d\u591c\u57ce\", \"\u897f\u5b89\u5927\u96c1\u5854\"]."
